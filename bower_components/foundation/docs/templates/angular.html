<h2>AngularJS</h2>
<h3 class="subheader">Foundation for Apps uses AngularJS to power your web application. It is a well tested, flexible, and powerful framework for building amazing web apps.</h3>

<h3 class="subheader">We streamlined how you implement Foundation plugins by using Angular directives with simple naming, meaning fewer classes and divs for you to remember. Foundation is also built on top of <a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/site/#/api/ui.router.router.%24urlRouter"> UI Router</a> which makes Angular more accessible for designers!</h3>
